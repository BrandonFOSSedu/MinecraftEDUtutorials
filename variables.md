## Variables and Data @showdialog

The Typescript language is based on Javascript, but with additional support for static data types and error checking.

Today we will take a look at some of the basic types of Typescript and how to use variables in Minecraft programming.

## Creating variables

Typescript lets users create variables using the ``let`` keyword, followed by a user defined *identifier*.

An identifier is a *name* for a variable. Once given a value, variables can be used in other parts of the program where the name will be replaced by the current value of the variable.

```typescript
let x : number = 0
```
