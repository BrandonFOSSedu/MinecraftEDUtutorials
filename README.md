# Minecraft Education Edition Tutorials - Event Driven Commands

In order to program in Minecraft Education Edition we need to test for certain events in order to trigger our code.

## Step 1: Welcome to the Tutorial @showdialog

Here's an introduction screen.


## Step 2: Player Event Driven Blocks

Coders can use player events to execute a block of code.
Some different stuff

``typescript
player.onChat("Hello world", function() {
}``

* Bullet point
* Bullet point 2

```blockconfig.local
player.onChat("hello", function() {
})
player.onItemInteracted(IRON_SHOVEL, function() {
    
})
blocks.place(STONE, pos(0, 0, 0))
```

```blocks
player.onChat("hello", function() {
})
player.onItemInteracted(IRON_SHOVEL, function() {
    
})
blocks.place(STONE, pos(0, 0, 0))
```





Here's some hint stuff

```template
let x : number = 0
```


## Step 2: Run your code
Put some blocks onto the stage
